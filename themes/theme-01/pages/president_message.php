            <p>Dear Friends,</p>

            <p>If the challenges of the past few years have taught us anything,<br />
                it is that we are all one community &ndash; and we must take care of<br />
                each other the way strong communities do. Strong communities<br />
                are active, not static. They grow and change to welcome new<br />
                members. They adapt to new circumstances and opportunities. Most<br />
                importantly, they take special care of people who are struggling.<br />
                At the Memorial Foundation, we are privileged to partner with our area&rsquo;s<br />
                nonprofit community, bearing witness to the ways in which they exemplify<br />
                the definition of a strong community &ndash; every day and in every way.</p>
